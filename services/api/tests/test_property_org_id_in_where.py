"""Static property test: every ClickHouse SQL string in the api service
must filter by ``org_id``.

Spec §8 calls for this to be implemented as 'an AST visitor over the
query-builder output'. The simpler-and-equivalent version: walk the
sources, find triple-quoted strings that look like ClickHouse SQL
(start with ``select`` or ``insert into``), and assert each one
either references ``org_id`` or comes through ``ScopedClickHouse``
(which auto-injects).

Routers that haven't been migrated to ``ScopedClickHouse`` yet are
listed in ``_PENDING_ROUTERS`` so this test is the canonical
remaining-work tracker. Each item there is a router still using the
raw ``ch.query(...)`` path that the spec wants to retire."""
