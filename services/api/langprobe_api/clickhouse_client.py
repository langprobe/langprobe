"""Thin ClickHouse client used by read-side routers.

clickhouse-connect's `Client` is sync AND not thread-safe — concurrent
calls within the same client raise "Attempt to execute concurrent
queries within the same session". One client per process can't serve
a fan-out request like the home page (which fires 3-4 reads in
parallel).

We keep a small thread-safe pool of clients. Each call checks one out
of the pool, runs the query in a thread, returns it. The pool grows
lazily up to a cap; no client is ever shared between two concurrent
calls.

Failure surfaces as an exception so routers can translate to 503; we
prefer that to a 200 with stale or empty data. The hot trace ingest
path stays on the dedicated ingest service — these helpers are for
low-volume CRUD + read fan-out only.
